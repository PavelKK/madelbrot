# Web Worker Mandelbrot Fractals

This repository showcases the utilization of web worker technology to enhance the performance of generating and rendering Mandelbrot fractals. The Mandelbrot fractal is a fascinating mathematical construct known for its intricate and beautiful patterns. By harnessing the power of web workers, this project aims to efficiently compute and visualize Mandelbrot fractals in a responsive and interactive manner.

## Features

- Utilizes web workers to distribute the computational load, enhancing responsiveness and reducing UI-blocking.
- Interactive visualization of Mandelbrot fractals through an intuitive user interface.
- Dynamic parameter adjustments for zooming and panning to explore different regions of the fractal.
- Real-time rendering updates for seamless navigation and exploration.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas: For rendering the graphical representation of Mandelbrot fractals.
- JavaScript: Core programming language for implementing fractal generation and web worker logic.
- Web Workers: Leverages multi-threading to perform parallel computations for faster rendering.
- User Interface: Simple yet engaging UI elements for user interaction and exploration.
